Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday announced his intention to introduce legislation that would make Election Day a national holiday to give Americans more opportunity to vote.\r\n\r\n\"In America, we should be celebrating our democracy and doing everything possible to make it easier for people to participate in the political process. Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote. While this would not be a cure-all, it would indicate a national commitment to create a more vibrant democracy,\" the progressive senator said in a statement.\r\n\r\nTurnout in Tuesday's elections clocked in at a paltry 37 percent, compared to about 41 percent in 2010, according to data from the United States Elections Project. If that projection holds, it would be the lowest voter turnout since 1942.\r\n\r\nThe voters who did show up to vote largely skewed older, whiter and more male compared with other election cycles, and the results were obvious. Republicans picked up control of the Senate, gained seats in the House, won key gubernatorial posts and greatly expanded their hold on state legislatures. Younger and minority voters, on the other hand, largely stayed at home. Voters in the 18-29 age range made up only 13 percent of the electorate, compared with nearly a quarter that were seniors, who tend to support Republicans.\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama acknowledged the matter in a press conference on Wednesday, saying, \"To the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you, too.\"\r\n\r\nBut the number of people who vote in midterm elections isn't the only problem according to Sanders. The Vermont independent also called typical levels of turnout in presidential elections \"an international embarrassment.\" The number is higher in presidential years, but the U.S. still ranks behind 120 other countries in average turnout.\r\n\r\n\"We should not be satisfied with a 'democracy' in which more than 60 percent of our people don't vote and some 80 percent of young people and low-income Americans fail to vote,\" he added. \"We can and must do better than that. While we must also focus on campaign finance reform and public funding of elections, establishing an Election Day holiday would be an important step forward.\"\r\n\r\nSanders said he would file the bill, titled ''Democracy Day Act of 2014,\" once Congress reconvenes next week.\r\n\r\n- http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/07/bernie-sanders-election-day-holiday_n_6121674.html", "title": "Sanders Wants to Make Election Day A Holiday", "created_date": "2015-07-06T23:50:14Z"}, "pk": 4}, {"model": "news.post", "fields": {"author": 1, "published_date": "2015-07-07T07:22:07.265Z", "text": "voteforbernie.org to see how you need to register in order to be able to vote for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Presidential Primaries.", "title": "Check To See How To Vote For Bernie", "created_date": "2015-07-07T07:22:07.257Z"}, "pk": 5}, {"model": "news.post", "fields": {"author": 1, "published_date": "2015-07-07T07:23:48.032Z", "text": "We can't win if we don't vote!", "title": "Reminder: Vote In The Primaries", "created_date": "2015-07-07T07:23:48.025Z"}, "pk": 8}, {"model": "policies.title", "fields": {"author": 1, "published_date": "2015-07-13T23:54:04.455Z", "name": "Climate Change", "text": "<div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n<font size=\"3\" face=\"Lato\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>What is climate change?</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Climate Change' encompasses global warming, which is the long-term warming of the planet, but also includes the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. These include rising sea levels, shrinking mountain glaciers, accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic, and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. These are all consequences of the warming, which is caused mainly by the people burning fossil fuels and putting out heat-trapping gases into the air. Also to note, the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide which are changing the natural gases.<sup><a href=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence\">[1]</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Is there evidence supporting climate change?</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjuGCJJUGsg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThroughout the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat with the most recent ice age ending around 7,000 years ago near the time of human civilization. However, in regards to the current warming trends NASA says, \"The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is very likely human-induced and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented in the past 1,300 years.\" We have been able to gather evidence through means of newer technology such as Earth-orbiting satellites.  Sine evidence supporting this information that has been collected that directly points to climate change is sea level rise,  global temperature rise, warming oceans, shrinking ice sheets, declining arctic ice sea, glacial retreat, and extreme events (hurricanes, increased rain fall, drought, etc...), ocean acidification, and decreased snow cover.<sup><a href=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence\">[1] </a></sup>You can read more about the specific evidence and causes from climate change on NASA's <a href=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence\">website.</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/203_co2-graph-1280x800.jpg\" width=\"900\" alt=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/203_co2-graph-1280x800.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>If the evidence is so Compelling, then how can people still deny its existence?</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we look at the 2016 presidential candidates we see a large amount of the candidates either \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Denying climate change is happening completely.</li>\r\n<li>Refusing to acknowledge it because the science is not compelling enough or refusing to acknowledge it for no reason.</li>\r\n<li>Kind of dodge around the issue not really answering the questions.</li>\r\n<li>Says that it exists but exploring new options to replace coal won't have a change or will cut all the jobs.<li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSome of the people who fall in these four categories are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ted Cruz<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX6nDrqUKKA\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Jeb Bush<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI0-pe14l_A\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Carly Fiorina<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xbO8y31A7Q\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Mike Huckabee<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dm0wTlJ6nk\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Bobby Jindal<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seBeDAlYHec\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Rick Perryl<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYOQDz9Gt0Q\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Marco Rubio<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M-HuEX0rOY\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Rick Santorum<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6jWGWlAF50\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Donald Trump<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVZNZzUB1Ik\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Rick Santorum<sup><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRgLu8mb2gA\">[source]</a></sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhy wouldn't any of these people acknowledge or move towards ways to actively fight climate change when 97% of the worldwide community of scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made, and an actual threat that we are way behind on preventing? Well, when you look at many of the donors for these people you will see a lot of oil companies who obviously do not want to see a reduction in oil production because that means a loss in money for them. For example, the Koch brothers plan to spend about $889 million budget for the 2016 elections only within the Republican Party<sup><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/26/koch-brothers-network-announces-889-million-budget-for-next-two-years/22363809/\">[2]</a></sup>. To put that into perspective, during the 2012 presidential election between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, they each spent just over a billion dollars between all of their funding for their campaign and everything. That means that one single group of brothers are going to spend almost as much on one candidate or across a couple candidates, what the entire Republican Party or the entire Democratic Party had spent on the entire 2012 elections. \r\n</br>\r\nHillary Clinton is not exceptionally clean from this list either. While she talks a big game about fighting climate change and talking about the disaster that we face if we ignore it, she was known to promote fracking across the world while she was secretary of state, she takes a lot of money from oil companies (ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, etc...), she supported off-shore drilling, and she completely dodges questions in regards to the Keystone XL<sup><a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-hillary-clinton-and-climate-change/\">[3]</a></sup>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>So what's so bad about the Koch Brothers wanting to invest in what they think is right?</em></h2></center>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5tAT6ciJ4s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Where does Bernie Sanders stand?</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>Stance in 2015</center>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxLwmGPMLJk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>Stance in 2007</center>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAKuZXXDU8I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n</p>\r\n</br>\r\n</br>\r\n</br>\r\n<center><small>References</small></center>\r\n<small>[1] Global Climate Change: Evidence.

If somebody is bright and has the ability, not everybody does, and has the desire to get a higher education should we say to that person, 'No you can't do that because you don't have enough money or you are going to leave school $80,000 in debt?' or do we say, 'Hey we need your brains, we need your energy, to make us a competitive global economic nation.'\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBernie Sanders thinks that higher education, specifically public colleges and universities should be a right to the American people and should be about whether you have the desire and intelligence to get a degree, not based solely on the fact of whether you can pay for it or not. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Ahh, That Just Means You Are Going To Tax Me More!</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNot necessarily, to achieve this goal, it will cost about $70 billion. Bernie Sanders has already introduced legislation to make college and universities free by imposing a Wall Street speculation fee on investment houses, hedge funds, and other speculators of 0.5% on stock trades ($0.50 for every $100 worth of stock), a 0.1% fee on bonds, and a 0.005% fee on derivatives. It is estimated that this increase will bring in hundreds of billions a year which will be used to not only make college and university tuition free, but also create millions of jobs all across America<sup><a href=\"http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/19/bernie-sanders-plans-college-free-raising-taxes-wall-street.html\">[1]</a></sup>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>What Else Is In This Legislation?</em></h2></center>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Work Study Reforms: \"Today, the federal work study program receives less than $1 billion per year, and serves nearly 700,000 students.

But when actually asking Bernie Sanders about this subject, he does not deny that he is a Democratic Socialist, instead he asks what's wrong with that? He then usually points to countries with similar beliefs that he has (primarily the Scandinavian countries) and shows how they have very successful higher education programs which are nearly identical to the one he is trying to implement in the United States. All three of these countries, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, all have a free higher education program in place, a healthcare as a right system (talked about in the Healthcare category), and all three have a higher standard of living and happiness then the United States. Somewhat attributed to education, childhood poverty is also a big issue that we face in our country.

Almost all politicians in this day and age are bought by big money, whether that is through big banks, wallstreet firms, or extremely wealthy corporations. This creates a system in which the people who are supposed to be representing America and what we stand for have a conflict of interest because their entire political careers are funded by people with almost polar opposite views than the American public. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, we have very, very few political representatives left who do not adhere to the demands of big money interests and actually do their best to represent the people they were voted to represent. One of these people left standing is Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders has never received money from a Super PAC and is the only candidate this presidential election who can honestly say that they have no conflict of interest other than that of the majority of people in this country. This infograph is a good representation of the money and who supports who.</p>\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://reverbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Campaign-contributions-Hillary-Cilnton-vs-Bernie-Sanders.jpg\" width=\"900\">\r\n<center><small>As you can see, Hillary Clinton recieves funding from corporations, banks, and media, while Bernie Sanders recieves funding from the people.</small></center>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</br>\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Negative Campaigning</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnother thing about Bernie Sanders morality is that he absolutely hates negative campaigning. He has never, ever run a negative campaign ad in his life. If you are curious as the what these negative campaign ads are, here are a few (the first is a Romney attack ad from Obama's campaign and the second is a Obama attack ad from Romney's campaign):\r\n</br>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWdZEJW1vWY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QSIIzbYRdo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Civil Rights</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen it comes to civil rights and liberties, Bernie Sanders has always been the front runner pushing for a more equal society unlike some of his colleagues. As we are aware now by the many outcries, most in the Republican Party are trying to gather petitions for the Gay Marriage ruling, and do not believe that they should have equal rights. This viewpoint is pretty out of touch with most of America in regards to civil rights. Hillary Clinton has come out on this campaign and stated that she completely supports the right for Gay Marriage. That being said, here is a clip spanning her career on her stance to Gay Marriage along with the relevant polls from that same month/year.\r\n</p>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"590\" height=\"332\" src=\"http://launch.newsinc.com/?type=VideoPlayer/Single&widgetId=1&trackingGroup=69016&siteSection=washingtonexaminer&videoId=28957832\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" noresize marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis video is a prime example of the state of politics in America. Most politicians do not say the right thing, or do not say their specific opinion, but they are purely going to say what the majority of people want to hear which is bad. Fortunately, this would change with Bernie Sanders as president. Back in the early 1970s when Gay Marriage and Gay rights weren't a hot subject and not a majority either, Bernie Sanders wrote a letter while a candidate for the governor of Vermont that included...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBernie Sanders and \"... The Liberty Union believe that there are entirely too many laws that regulate human behavior. Let us abolish all laws which attempt to impose a particular brand of morality or 'right' on people. Let's abolish all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc..).\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Mainstream Attention</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If Bernie Sanders is such a perfect candidate, then why doesn't it seem that way on television? Well, one of the biggest factors here is who funds the television networks, they have complete control and are multi-billion dollar industries only interested in the best for their business. So what happens is, you have a presidential candidate breaking the status quo by saying that 1 in 4 corporations doesn't pay a nickle in tax and that needs to change which is not in the best interest for these companies. Here is a video describing Sanders' opinion on news outlets and mainstream media. </p>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIzStSnn4Oc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n</font>"}, "pk": 7}, {"model": "policies.title", "fields": {"author": 1, "published_date": "2015-07-13T23:52:34.608Z", "name": "Income Distribution", "text": "<font size=\"3\" face=\"Lato\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>What is the current Income Distribution in America?</em></h2></center>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPKKQnijnsM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>We live in a system right now, where the gap between the extremely wealthy and the middle class of America has never been as wide since the Great Depression. This is caused by many many different things one of the things that proves this is the stagnant middle class income. between the years of 2010-2013, the middle class median income stayed stuck at $96,500 while the poor median income actually dropped from $10,500 to $9,300. The wealth of upper-income families jumped an increasing amount from $595,300 to $639,400. This shows how clear it is that the gap between the wealthiest and the middle class and lower is increasing at an extremely large rate. The scariest part about this is that, as shown by the video, people perceive the system and gap to be not even close to what it actually is.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>How was this huge wealth gap caused?</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ik1y4ZNSjek\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>How do we fix this problem?</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This part is where a lot of the honesty and morality in our presidential candidates come into play. With all of our current presidential candidates, both Democrats and Republicans (excluding Bernie Sanders), receiving extraordinary amounts of money from big money interests, and then those candidates talk about how much they want to help grow the working class of America, can we really trust them? Most of these candidates are receiving money directly from the people who helped put us in the spot that they benefit from and the rest of America does not. Do you think they would be funding a campaign that would change their dominance over the country? Luckily, this for the 2016 campaign, Bernie Sanders has a lot of plans to try and fix this problem that we are facing in our nation and he has no reason not to mean what he's saying. After all, he has essentially had the same exact message since the early '70s when his career first began.</p>\r\n<p><center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pSGb2aF3Dbc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>\r\n<p>As discussed in this video, Bernie Sanders wants to start solving these problems of inequality by raising the minimum wage and create jobs to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Not discussed in this video is the stance he takes on wanting to stop loopholes that allow major corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands to prevent having to pay taxes on them. In regards to the first to plans, many will say, well those both cost a lot of money, raising the minimum wage will just make the price of goods go higher, the infrastructure is fine in our country, etc...\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Whats wrong with the Infrastructure and what is Bernie's plan to fix it?</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wpzvaqypav8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmvVZ5wAAa4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center><h2><em>Raising the Minimum Wage</em></h2></center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\n<center><small>References</small></center>\r\n<small>[1] Strachan, Maxwell. \"U.S. Wealth Gap Hits Record High.\" The Huffington Post.
