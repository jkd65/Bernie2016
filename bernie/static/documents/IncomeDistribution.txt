<p>We live in a system right now, where the gap between the extremely wealthy and the middle class of America has never been as wide since the Great Depression. This is caused by many many different things one of the things that proves this is the stagnant middle class income. between the years of 2010-2013, the middle class median income stayed stuck at $96,500 while the poor median income actually dropped from $10,500 to $9,300. The wealth of upper-income families jumped an increasing amount from $595,300 to $639,400. This shows how clear it is that the gap between the wealthiest and the middle class and lower is increasing at an extremely large rate. The scariest part about this is that, as shown by the video, people perceive the system and gap to be not even close to what it actually is.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<center><h2><em>How do we fix this problem?</em></h2></center>
</p>

<p>This part is where a lot of the honesty and morality in our presidential candidates come into play. With all of our current presidential candidates, both Democrats and Republicans (excluding Bernie Sanders), receiving extraordinary amounts of money from big money interests, and then those candidates talk about how much they want to help grow the working class of America, can we really trust them? Most of these candidates are receiving money directly from the people who helped put us in the spot that they benefit from and the rest of America does not. Do you think they would be funding a campaign that would change their dominance over the country? Luckily, this for the 2016 campaign, Bernie Sanders has a lot of plans to try and fix this problem that we are facing in our nation and he has no reason not to mean what he's saying. After all, he has essentially had the same exact message since the early '70s when his career first began.</p>

<p>As discussed in this video, Bernie Sanders wants to start solving these problems of inequality by raising the minimum wage and create jobs to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Not discussed in this video is the stance he takes on wanting to stop loopholes that allow major corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands to prevent having to pay taxes on them. In regards to the first to plans, many will say, well those both cost a lot of money, raising the minimum wage will just make the price of goods go higher, the infrastructure is fine in our country, etc...
