<center><h2><em>Big Money in Politics</em></h2></center>
</p>

<p>When it comes to modern politics, and especially with the ruling of citizens united (which was a supreme court case that allowed Super PACs the ability to receive money from corporations that is primarily used to create and promote hate ads toward other presidential candidates), we have a system in which honest politicians are an extremely hard to come by. Almost all politicians in this day and age are bought by big money, whether that is through big banks, wallstreet firms, or extremely wealthy corporations. This creates a system in which the people who are supposed to be representing America and what we stand for have a conflict of interest because their entire political careers are funded by people with almost polar opposite views than the American public. </p>

<p>Fortunately, we have very, very few political representatives left who do not adhere to the demands of big money interests and actually do their best to represent the people they were voted to represent. One of these people left standing is Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders has never received money from a Super PAC and is the only candidate this presidential election who can honestly say that they have no conflict of interest other than that of the majority of people in this country. This infograph is a good representation of the money and who supports who.</p>

<center><h2><em>Negative Campaigning</em></h2></center>
</p>
<p>
Another thing about Bernie Sanders morality is that he absolutely hates negative campaigning. He has never, ever run a negative campaign ad in his life. If you are curious as the what these negative campaign ads are, here are a few (the first is a Romney attack ad from Obama's campaign and the second is a Obama attack ad from Romney's campaign):

<center><h2><em>Civil Rights</em></h2></center>
</p>
<p>
When it comes to civil rights and liberties, Bernie Sanders has always been the front runner pushing for a more equal society unlike some of his colleagues. As we are aware now by the many outcries, most in the Republican Party are trying to gather petitions for the Gay Marriage ruling, and do not believe that they should have equal rights. This viewpoint is pretty out of touch with most of America in regards to civil rights. Hillary Clinton has come out on this campaign and stated that she completely supports the right for Gay Marriage. That being said, here is a clip spanning her career on her stance to Gay Marriage along with the relevant polls from that same month/year.

This video is a prime example of the state of politics in America. Most politicians do not say the right thing, or do not say their specific opinion, but they are purely going to say what the majority of people want to hear which is bad. Fortunately, this would change with Bernie Sanders as president. Back in the early 1970s when Gay Marriage and Gay rights weren't a hot subject and not a majority either, Bernie Sanders wrote a letter while a candidate for the governor of Vermont that included...
</p>
<p>
Bernie Sanders and "... The Liberty Union believe that there are entirely too many laws that regulate human behavior. Let us abolish all laws which attempt to impose a particular brand of morality or 'right' on people. Let's abolish all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc..)."

<center><h2><em>Mainstream Attention</em></h2></center>
</p>
<p>If Bernie Sanders is such a perfect candidate, then why doesn't it seem that way on television? Well, one of the biggest factors here is who funds the television networks, they have complete control and are multi-billion dollar industries only interested in the best for their business. So what happens is, you have a presidential candidate breaking the status quo by saying that 1 in 4 corporations doesn't pay a nickle in tax and that needs to change which is not in the best interest for these companies. Here is a video describing Sanders' opinion on news outlets and mainstream media. </p>
