<center><h2><em>Bernie's Stance on Higher Education</em></h2></center>
</p>
<p>
"... If somebody is bright and has the ability, not everybody does, and has the desire to get a higher education should we say to that person, 'No you can't do that because you don't have enough money or you are going to leave school $80,000 in debt?' or do we say, 'Hey we need your brains, we need your energy, to make us a competitive global economic nation.'"
</p>
<p>
Bernie Sanders thinks that higher education, specifically public colleges and universities should be a right to the American people and should be about whether you have the desire and intelligence to get a degree, not based solely on the fact of whether you can pay for it or not.

Not necessarily, to achieve this goal, it will cost about $70 billion. Bernie Sanders has already introduced legislation to make college and universities free by imposing a Wall Street speculation fee on investment houses, hedge funds, and other speculators of 0.5% on stock trades ($0.50 for every $100 worth of stock), a 0.1% fee on bonds, and a 0.005% fee on derivatives. It is estimated that this increase will bring in hundreds of billions a year which will be used to not only make college and university tuition free, but also create millions of jobs all across America<sup><a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/19/bernie-sanders-plans-college-free-raising-taxes-wall-street.html">[1]</a></sup>.

<center><h2><em>What Else Is In This Legislation?</em></h2></center>
<ul>
<li>Work Study Reforms: "Today, the federal work study program receives less than $1 billion per year, and serves nearly 700,000 students. This legislation would expand the number of students and colleges that can offer part-time employment and participate in the federal work study program, and focus funding on schools that enroll high numbers of low-income students."</li>
<li>Restoration of Historically Low Student Loan Interest Rates: "The College for All Act would lower student loan interest rates by restoring the formula which was in effect until 2006. Student load interest rates would be cut almost in half for undergraduate students, dropping from 4.32% to just 2.32%."</li>
<li>Student Load Re-financing: "The College for All Act would enable borrowers to refinance their loans based on the interest rates available to current students."<sup><a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/19/bernie-sanders-plans-college-free-raising-taxes-wall-street.html">[1]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<center><h2><em>If This Was Such A Great Idea, Then Why Don't We See More Examples Of It?</em></h2></center>

This is one of the stances that Bernie Sanders has that makes him a Democratic Socialist, which has been a talking point when his name is brought up. But when actually asking Bernie Sanders about this subject, he does not deny that he is a Democratic Socialist, instead he asks what's wrong with that? He then usually points to countries with similar beliefs that he has (primarily the Scandinavian countries) and shows how they have very successful higher education programs which are nearly identical to the one he is trying to implement in the United States. All three of these countries, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, all have a free higher education program in place, a healthcare as a right system (talked about in the Healthcare category), and all three have a higher standard of living and happiness then the United States. Somewhat attributed to education, childhood poverty is also a big issue that we face in our country. The three countries that have a free higher education system all are within  0%-10% in childhood poverty placing them in the top 7 countries in the world with lowest childhood poverty rates, while the United States has about a 25% childhood poverty rate placing us at 34th on the list being the 2nd to last developed country on the list of low childhood poverty rates<sup><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/04/15/map-how-35-countries-compare-on-child-poverty-the-u-s-is-ranked-34th/">[2]</a></sup>.
