<center><h2><em>What is climate change?</em></h2></center>
</p>

<p>
"Climate Change' encompasses global warming, which is the long-term warming of the planet, but also includes the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. These include rising sea levels, shrinking mountain glaciers, accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic, and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. These are all consequences of the warming, which is caused mainly by the people burning fossil fuels and putting out heat-trapping gases into the air. Also to note, the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide which are changing the natural gases.<sup><a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence">[1]</a></sup>

Throughout the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat with the most recent ice age ending around 7,000 years ago near the time of human civilization. However, in regards to the current warming trends NASA says, "The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is very likely human-induced and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented in the past 1,300 years." We have been able to gather evidence through means of newer technology such as Earth-orbiting satellites.  Sine evidence supporting this information that has been collected that directly points to climate change is sea level rise,  global temperature rise, warming oceans, shrinking ice sheets, declining arctic ice sea, glacial retreat, and extreme events (hurricanes, increased rain fall, drought, etc...), ocean acidification, and decreased snow cover.<sup><a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence">[1] </a></sup>You can read more about the specific evidence and causes from climate change on NASA's <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence">website.</a>

<center><h2><em>If the evidence is so Compelling, then how can people still deny its existence?</em></h2></center>
</p>

<p>
When we look at the 2016 presidential candidates we see a large amount of the candidates either 
<ol>
<li>Denying climate change is happening completely.</li>
<li>Refusing to acknowledge it because the science is not compelling enough or refusing to acknowledge it for no reason.</li>
<li>Kind of dodge around the issue not really answering the questions.</li>
<li>Says that it exists but exploring new options to replace coal won't have a change or will cut all the jobs.<li>
</ol>
Some of the people who fall in these four categories are:
<ul>
<li>Ted Cruz<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX6nDrqUKKA">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Jeb Bush<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI0-pe14l_A">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Carly Fiorina<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xbO8y31A7Q">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Mike Huckabee<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dm0wTlJ6nk">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Bobby Jindal<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seBeDAlYHec">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Rick Perryl<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYOQDz9Gt0Q">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Marco Rubio<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M-HuEX0rOY">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Rick Santorum<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6jWGWlAF50">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Donald Trump<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVZNZzUB1Ik">[source]</a></sup></li>
<li>Rick Santorum<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRgLu8mb2gA">[source]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
Why wouldn't any of these people acknowledge or move towards ways to actively fight climate change when 97% of the worldwide community of scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made, and an actual threat that we are way behind on preventing? Well, when you look at many of the donors for these people you will see a lot of oil companies who obviously do not want to see a reduction in oil production because that means a loss in money for them. For example, the Koch brothers plan to spend about $889 million budget for the 2016 elections only within the Republican Party<sup><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/26/koch-brothers-network-announces-889-million-budget-for-next-two-years/22363809/">[2]</a></sup>. To put that into perspective, during the 2012 presidential election between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, they each spent just over a billion dollars between all of their funding for their campaign and everything. That means that one single group of brothers are going to spend almost as much on one candidate or across a couple candidates, what the entire Republican Party or the entire Democratic Party had spent on the entire 2012 elections. 
</br>
Hillary Clinton is not exceptionally clean from this list either. While she talks a big game about fighting climate change and talking about the disaster that we face if we ignore it, she was known to promote fracking across the world while she was secretary of state, she takes a lot of money from oil companies (ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, etc...), she supported off-shore drilling, and she completely dodges questions in regards to the Keystone XL<sup><a href="http://grist.org/climate-energy/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-hillary-clinton-and-climate-change/">[3]</a></sup>.
